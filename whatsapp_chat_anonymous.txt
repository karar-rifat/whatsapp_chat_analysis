One way is to split that column with the space condition (you may choose every space, if the digits are into 6 or more)  as the thing to look for. Then after splitting, merge them again with nothing as condition to join them in between. That way, the space would have gone.. However make sure that the column you select first is the one that should start your actual number, or in that sequence if the result splits are more than 2.. After merging, then change data type to whole number or decimal as you might want.. The error is occurring because of how the data was structured from when and/or where imported...which is the space in between them.",2019-11-21 18:03:00,Thursday,768,145,18

We have the aggregated data that will be made available on the website shortly (I'm working to get it online right now).. From this point forward, you will be able to create a nice data model, details of which I'll also include a post tomorrow. For those that understand how to generate the schema in Excel, I invite you to try to generate one from all the MDAs and begin creating some visualisations..

Truly power query is fantastic, but we shouldn't forget that Excel as the grandparent has evolved over the years. Excel is more than 30 years old.. When I see power query generating codes for steps done, I reminisce on VBA and macros because that's the way the latter too generates codes when put to record actions.. Tableau is just 10 years plus, and it's very fantastic too. And again there are many packages to Tableau. When you are talking of data cleaning/preprocessing, Tableau Prep as a variant of the software, will do more for you than Tableau online or Desktop in data preparation, that's however unlike Power BI that everything is bundled into one software. And Tableau has way much more types of charts you can play with than Power BI. It will surprise you to know how many various charts you can make out of either column or bar charts alone. Power BI doesn't have that luxury, and when you need to supplement, you would have to be searching in the store..
